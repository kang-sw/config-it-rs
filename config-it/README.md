# `config-it`
**Asynchronous Centralized Configuration Management for Rust**

`config-it` is an asynchronous library that offers centralized configuration management for Rust applications. Here are its key features:

- Define custom configuration templates using structs.
- Create multiple instances with different paths based on a single template.
- Receive notifications when your instance is updated.
- Use `serde` compatible archive formats to archive your data in your preferred way.
- Manage property-wise dirty flags for precise, responsive updates to your system.
